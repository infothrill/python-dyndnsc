*Dyndnsc* is a command line client for sending updates to dynamic
dns (ddns, dyndns) services. It supports multiple protocols and services,

using foreign, but compatible services. *Dyndnsc* ships many different IP
detection mechanisms, support for configuring multiple services in one place
and it has a daemon mode for running unattended. It has a plugin system
to provide external notification services.
